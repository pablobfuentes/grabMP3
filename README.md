## 🛠️ How It Works

### Method 1: Screen Sharing (Recommended)

- Works best in Chrome and Edge browsers
- Requires screen sharing permission (audio is captured, not video)

### Method 2: Stereo Mix (Windows Fallback)
- Enables "Stereo Mix" in Windows audio settings
- Captures system audio through virtual audio device
- Works when screen sharing method fails

## 📋 Requirements

- **Browser**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- **OS**: Windows, Mac, or Linux
- **Audio**: System audio output (speakers/headphones)

1. Right-click the sound icon in your system tray
2. Select "Open Sound settings"
3. Click "More sound settings"
4. Go to "Recording" tab
5. Right-click in empty area and select "Show Disabled Devices"
